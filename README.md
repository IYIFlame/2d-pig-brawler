# 2d-pig-brawler
2d 2 person brawling game with flappy bird mechanics. Written in Lua using Love2d

To start the game go inside dist and double click flappy_death.exe . You will need a 64-bit machine for the game. Goal of the game is to kill your enemies/friends.

Up to 4 players can be spawned BUT there are keymappings only for 2! Player 1 spawns by pressing 1 on the keyboard and uses w to jump, a/d to change direction to left/right and shoot a rasher of bacon using v. Player 2 spawns by pressing 2 on the keyboard and uses the up arrow to jump and left/right arrows to change direction to left/right as well as lshift to shoot rashers of bacon.

A player can have a total of 3 rashers of bacon on the map at any given time. These rashers are destroyed after hitting a player or hitting a wall 3 times. A player can die from their own rasher! The game is physics-based so things such as higher and lower momentum are a thing.
